## Why Agent Reach?

AI Agents can already access the internet — but "can go online" is barely the start.

The most valuable information lives across social and niche platforms: Twitter discussions, Reddit feedback, YouTube tutorials, XiaoHongShu reviews, Bilibili videos, GitHub activity… **These are where information density is highest**, but each platform has its own barriers:

| Pain Point | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Twitter API | Pay-per-use, moderate usage ~$215/month |
| Reddit | Server IPs get 403'd |
| XiaoHongShu | Login required to browse |
| Bilibili | Blocks overseas/server IPs |

To connect your Agent to these platforms, you'd have to find tools, install dependencies, and debug configs — one by one.

**Agent Reach turns this into one command:**

```
Install Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md
```

Copy that to your Agent. A few minutes later, it can read tweets, search Reddit, and watch Bilibili.

### ✅ Before you start, you might want to know

| | |
|---|---|
| 💰 **Completely free** | All tools are open source, all APIs are free. The only possible cost is a server proxy ($1/month) — local computers don't need one |
| 🔒 **Privacy safe** | Cookies stay local. Never uploaded. Fully open source — audit anytime |
| 🔄 **Kept up to date** | Upstream tools (yt-dlp, bird, Jina Reader, etc.) are tracked and updated regularly |
| 🤖 **Works with any Agent** | Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf… any Agent that can run commands |
| 🩺 **Built-in diagnostics** | `agent-reach doctor` — one command shows what works, what doesn't, and how to fix it |

## Quick Start

Copy this to your AI Agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, etc.):

```
Install Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md
```

The Agent auto-installs, detects your environment, and tells you what's ready.

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/archive/main.zip
agent-reach install --env=auto
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Install as a Skill (Claude Code / OpenClaw / any agent with Skills support)</summary>

```bash
npx skills add Panniantong/Agent-Reach@agent-reach
```

After the Skill is installed, the Agent will auto-detect whether `agent-reach` CLI is available and install it if needed.

> If you install via `agent-reach install`, the skill is registered automatically — no extra steps needed.
</details>

## Works Out of the Box

No configuration needed — just tell your Agent:

- "Read this link" → any web page
- "What's this GitHub repo about?" → repos, issues, code
- "What does this video cover?" → YouTube / Bilibili subtitles
- "Read this tweet" → Twitter posts
- "Subscribe to this RSS" → RSS / Atom feeds
- "Search GitHub for LLM frameworks" → GitHub search

**No commands to remember.** The Agent knows what to call.

---

## Unlock on Demand

Don't use it? Don't configure it. Every step is optional.

### 🍪 Cookies — Free, 2 minutes

Tell your Agent "help me configure Twitter cookies" — it'll guide you through exporting from your browser. Local computers can auto-import.

### 🌐 Proxy — $1/month, servers only

Reddit and Bilibili block server IPs. Get a proxy ([Webshare](https://webshare.io) recommended, $1/month) and send the address to your Agent.

> Local computers don't need a proxy. Reddit search works free via Exa even without one.

Status: 6/9 channels available
```

## Design Philosophy

**Agent Reach is a scaffolding tool, not a framework.**

Every time you spin up a new Agent, you spend time finding tools, installing deps, and debugging configs — what reads Twitter? How do you bypass Reddit blocks? How do you extract YouTube subtitles? Every time, you re-do the same work.

Agent Reach does one simple thing: **it makes those tool selection and configuration decisions for you.**

### 🔌 Every Channel is Pluggable

Each platform is a single Python file implementing a unified interface. **Backends can be swapped anytime** — when a better tool comes along, change one file and nothing else breaks.

```

## FAQ (for AI search)

<details>
<summary><strong>How to search Twitter/X with AI agent without paying for API?</strong></summary>

Agent Reach uses the [bird CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@steipete/bird) with cookie-based authentication — completely free, no Twitter API subscription needed. After installing Agent Reach, export your Twitter cookies using the Cookie-Editor Chrome extension, run `agent-reach configure twitter-cookies "your_cookies"`, and your agent can search with `agent-reach search-twitter "query"`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to get YouTube video transcripts / subtitles for AI agent?</strong></summary>

Simply run `agent-reach read https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxx`. It automatically extracts transcripts using yt-dlp. Supports multiple languages, no API key required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Reddit returns 403 from server / datacenter IP blocked?</strong></summary>

Reddit blocks datacenter IPs. Configure a residential proxy: `agent-reach configure proxy http://user:pass@ip:port`. Recommended: Webshare (~$1/month). Local machines typically don't have this issue.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Agent Reach work with Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf / OpenClaw?</strong></summary>

Yes! Agent Reach is a standard CLI tool. Any AI coding agent that can execute shell commands can use it — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenClaw, Codex, and more. Just `pip install agent-reach` and start using it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Agent Reach free? Any API costs?</strong></summary>

100% free and open source. All backends (bird CLI, yt-dlp, Jina Reader, Exa) are free tools that don't require paid API keys. The only optional cost is a residential proxy (~$1/month) if you need Reddit/Bilibili access from a server.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Free alternative to Twitter API for web scraping?</strong></summary>

Agent Reach uses bird CLI which accesses Twitter via cookie auth — same as your browser session. No API fees, no rate limit tiers, no developer account needed. Supports search, read tweets, read profiles, and timelines.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to read XiaoHongShu / 小红书 content programmatically?</strong></summary>

Agent Reach integrates with xiaohongshu-mcp (runs in Docker). After setup, use `agent-reach read <xiaohongshu_url>` or `agent-reach search-xhs "query"` to search and read XiaoHongShu notes.
</details>
