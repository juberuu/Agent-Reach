# Content Analyzer Skill

> Any content → structured analysis report with actionable insights

## Trigger

When user sends content (URL, text, or transcript) with analysis intent:
- `/analyze [URL]`
- "Analyze this article"
- "What are the key takeaways?"
- Auto-triggered after video/podcast transcription (from video skill)

## Pipeline

### Step 1: Get Content

Choose tool based on input type:

| Input | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Tweet URL | `fetch_tweet` or Jina Reader |
| Web URL | `WebFetch` or Jina Reader |
| Local file | Read file directly |
| Transcript from video skill | Use directly |

### Step 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis

Scan content across these dimensions. Only output dimensions with actual content — skip empty ones.

```markdown
## 📖 Summary

[1-3 sentence core thesis]

**Source**: [author/publisher] · [date]
**Type**: [tweet/article/video/podcast/report]

### Step 3: Personalized Relevance (Customizable)

Map insights to YOUR context. Edit the dimensions below to match your own projects, interests, and systems.

```markdown
## 🔄 How This Applies to Me

### My Projects
- **[Project A]**: [How this insight connects]
- **[Project B]**: [What I could apply]

### My Knowledge Base
- **Update**: [Which notes/docs to update]

```

> **Customization**: Edit the dimensions in Step 2 and Step 3 to match your own
> domain. A trader might add "Market Impact" and "Risk Assessment". A developer
> might add "Architecture Patterns" and "Tech Debt". Make it yours.

## Output Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Full** (default) | `/analyze [URL]` | All dimensions |
| **Sparse** | `/analyze [URL] --sparse` | Only hit dimensions, skip empty |
| **Brief** | `/analyze [URL] --brief` | Action items only |

## Best Practices

1. **Scan all dimensions, but don't force-fill** — skip empty dimensions cleanly
2. **Actions must be specific** — not "learn about X" but "read X docs chapter Y"
3. **Distinguish fact from opinion** — mark the author's claims vs verified facts
4. **Source everything** — tag where each insight comes from in the original content
5. **ROI awareness** — not every action is worth doing, assess effort vs impact
